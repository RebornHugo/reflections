1.How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

My answer: It's easy for us to save compare the history version code file.

2.What do you think are the pros and cons(advantages and disadvantages) of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

My answer: 。。。。。。。。。。。。。

3.Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

My answer: Because the Git is designed to munipulate code, which is necessary for handle multiple files at the sane time.

4.How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

My answer: git log  => show all the version you have git commit
          git diff =>  git diff first-version second-version to see what have added and waht have deleted.

5.How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

My answer: we can use git checkout + Number to any version we have commited , so it's safe to change anything we want.

6.Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

My answer: Of course , for coding !!!!
