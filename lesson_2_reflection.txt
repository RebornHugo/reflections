1.What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

My answer: See my OneNote....by using ls -a we could find something concealed.....
           Using git status .

2.How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
  What value do you think it offers?

My answer: This place is used to store the file that you want to commit. Which means
          that we should use git add command to add the file in working directory
          to staging area ,then use git commit commad to commit the staging area to
          repository

3.How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

My answer: 1.Typing git diff to show the changes working directory versus staging
           area. 2.git add , git commit ,see whether the star or plus symbols is gone!

4.What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

My answer: When we want to try something else, in the meantime we don't want to
          change the master branch(or others), so we can create a new branch to do it.

5.How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

My answer: git log --graph --oneline master coins ,draw the diagram.
           Diagram can help us see the entire project clearly.

6.What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

My answer: this will merge the specific branch into checked-out branch. Every single change
in the specific branch will happened at the checked-out branch again.

7.What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
